This program installs and automatically updates Viramate. The extension communicates with it using Chrome Native Messaging, so it will be running in the background while the extension is in use.

This program is not released under any open source or public domain license - redistribution (especially of modified versions) is prohibited with the specific exception of forks where you are preparing a pull request. You're welcome to use a modified version for your own personal use if you like, and if you'd like to use this for an extension of your own, let me know and we can work something out. This is to ensure users of the extension get updates when something important changes in the game.

To compile it yourself you'll need Visual Studio 2017. The community version is enough. (OS X and Linux versions are probably possible using Mono or .NET core, but I haven't looked into that. Feel free to file a pull request if you come up with something.)
